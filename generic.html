								<p>Greetings fellow data enthusiasts and recruiters, my name is Minh Nguyen, but you can also call me Andrew. 
								I am a 21-year-old student who will be graduating from the Foreign Trade University - HN in August 2023 with <b>current GPA of 3.75</b>. 
								My journey towards becoming a Data Analyst started as a shot in the dark while I was exploring various career paths. 
								However, as I got more involved in it, I realized the perfect combination of my business mindset and passion for coding in this field. 
								<b>Now, I am confident that a career as a Data Analyst is what I truly want to pursue.</b>
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/am2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>For my background, I have <b>02 years</b> of experience working at <b>Tomorrow Enterpreneur Club - TEC-FTU</b> with one year as executive and another 
								year as Research & Development Deputy Head. Through participating in innovation sessions, developing strategic products and connecting partners, 
								I have developed important skills including research, project management, product development, leadership, and interpersonal communication. 
								With this experience and expertise, I am confident in my ability to effectively collaborate and adapt to any working environment. 
								Furthermore, I strive to define myself through my dedication to productivity and responsibility. 
								My relentless drive to do more and learn more sets me apart from others and is a constant source of motivation for me. 
								I believe that challenges are simply opportunities in disguise and approach every obstacle with a positive and proactive attitude. 
								With this mindset, I am confident in my ability to stand out and make a difference in any given situation.

								<p>During my time at university, I have achieved various certificates and awards. 
								Most recently, I completed the <b>Google Data Analytics program</b> and earned a Professional Certificate. 
								This has provided me with the skills to effectively prepare, process, analyze, and present data for informed decision-making. 
								In 2022, I was honored to be among the finalist teams awarded the <b>"Top 10 Best Performing Teams"</b> in the <b>VinUniversity Global Case Competition 2021</b>, 
								where VinFast was tasked with entering the US market. The competition drew participants from all over the world, including Belgium, China, 
								Finland, Korea, the UK, USA, and Vietnam, and provided me with a valuable opportunity to develop a strategic plan for VinFast's electric vehicles
								entering US automotive market.
