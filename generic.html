					            <h1>Let me tell you<br />about myself</h1>
					            <p>A Data Analyst / Business Intelligence professional with nearly 2 years of experience managing data systems and delivering actionable insights across multiple industries.
					                I specialize in optimizing ETL/ELT processes, building dynamic dashboards, and executing complex SQL queries using tools like MySQL, TiDB, Dremio, and Python.
					                My hands-on experience in data analysis has led to measurable improvements in reporting workflows, operational efficiency, and compliance accuracy.
					                With strong business acumen, I excel at transforming data into strategic decisions and leading cross-functional teams in data-driven projects.</p>

					        <p>Greetings fellow data enthusiasts and recruiters, my name is Minh Nguyen, but you can also call me Michael. I graduated from Foreign Trade University - Hanoi in September 2023 with a major in International Business Administration and a <b>GPA of 3.77</b>.</p>
						    
					        <p>Currently, I work at <b>OUTCUBATOR</b> as a <b>Business Intelligence Professional</b>, where I manage the BI system (MySQL, TiDB, Dremio, MinIO, and Superset) and optimize ETL/ELT processes for improved efficiency and data quality.
					            I have reduced report generation time by 90-95% by migrating sequential R scripts to concurrent Python scripts and leveraging Dremio’s reflection mechanism for readily available data views. 
					            I also develop dynamic dashboards and deliver ad-hoc reports, providing actionable insights for decision-making and risk analysis, resulting in a 30% improvement in operational efficiency.
					            Additionally, I enhanced the SDN/PEP search model, increasing accuracy by 15%, and led BI tool training sessions, ensuring secure data access across departments by managing role assignments with Superset Jinja.</p>
										
					        <p>Prior to OUTCUBATOR, I was a <b>Junior Data Analyst</b> at <b>Vietnam Communication Corporation (VCCORP)</b>, where I developed a BI system for 8 news-reading apps that tracked operational efficiency across user groups. 
					            I improved notification efficiency using rule-based segmentation and machine learning, leading to a 5% increase in notification efficiency and a 400% boost in specific segments. 
					            I also worked on solutions to re-engage users with declining activity, resulting in an 80% increase in active rates for targeted users and a 5% increase in DAU.
					            Additionally, I conducted hypothesis testing and ad-hoc analysis for various teams, boosting user engagement by 10%, and maintained real-time SLA monitoring dashboards across departments.</p>

						<p> During university, I earned several certificates and awards. Most recently, I completed the <b>Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</b>, which equipped me with essential skills in preparing, processing, and analyzing data for informed decision-making.
            						In 2022, I was honored to be among the Top 10 finalist teams (Top 3 Vietnamese Teams) in the <b>VinUniversity Global Case Competition</b>, where I developed a strategic plan for VinFast to enter the US market, 
							competing against teams from Belgium, China, Finland, Korea, the UK, the US, and Vietnam.</p>
